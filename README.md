# ⭐Plant-Disease-Detection
* Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. We used six different augmentation techniques for increasing the data-set size. For Training we are using Plant village dataset.
* There is a total of 39 Classes that we have to predict using the CNN Model.

## ⭐Run Project in your Machine
* You must have **Python3.8** installed in your machine.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewJWAiduGuld_9oGSrTuLumg9y62qS6A?usp=share_link)
* Add the downloaded file in `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.


## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not
